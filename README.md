Minecraft Masters Quest Modpack

(Minecraft - Masters Quest Modpack 1.12.2-14.23.5.2847)

### For Minecraft Java Ed. v1.12.2
### Forge v14.23.5.2847

## Background
A mod pack I made a couple of years back and spent about 1.5 years in the making. I don't play anymore, but my kids recommended I upload and share with the community.

I hope it a good resource at least for the scripting and resource pack, both which do a pretty good job of integrating multiple mods to include overwriting graphics, properties, and more. The two biggest things I'm proud of here is the scripts, recipies, etc. and the graphics changes for specific in game items.

## Summary

Just wanted to say this mod pack started around the tinyprogressions mod and thank you so much to Kashdeya @ curseforge.com (R.I.P.)
